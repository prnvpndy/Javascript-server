1) Edit, build, and debug with ease : For serious coding, you'll often benefit from tools with more code understanding than just blocks of text. 
2)Visual Studio Code includes built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.
3)Customize every feature to your liking and install any number of third-party extensions. While most scenarios work "out of the box" with no configuration, VS Code also grows with you, and we encourage you to optimize your experience to suit your unique needs.
