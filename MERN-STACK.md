MERN is full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier(MongoDB)

MERN STACK :    Mearn Stack is stand for Mango DB, Express.js, React.js & Node.js  

                Mango DB: Document Database
                Express(.js): Node.js framework
                React(.js): A Client-side Javascript Framework
                Node(.js):  Web Server
            
            MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular.js frontend framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any frontend JavaScript framework can work.

            Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.

How does Mern stack work?

            The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
    
                React.js Front End:  The top tier of the MERN stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML

                Express.js and Node.js Server Tier: The next level down is the Express.js server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server. Express.js bills itself as a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js," and that is indeed exactly what it is, Express.js has powerfull models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server function), and handling HTTP equest and responses.

                MangoDB Database Tier: If your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.), then you're going to want a database that's just as easy to work with as Angular, Express and Node.
                That's where MangoDB comes in: JSON documents created in your Angular.js frontend can be sent to the Express,js server, where they can be processed and (assuming they're valid) stored directly in MangoDB for later retrieval. 

MERN Use Cases: Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN - though itâ€™s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy,     
                cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces.

                    A few examples might be:

                        Workflow management
                        News aggregation
                        Todo apps and Calendars
                        Interactive forums / social products
                    And whatever else you can dream up!
